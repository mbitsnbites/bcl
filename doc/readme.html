    <h1>Instrucitons for building the manual</h1>
  </div>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>This document is for developers only. It briefly describes how to build the PDF
  manual for the Basic Compression Library (doc/manual.pdf).</p>


  <h2>LaTeX</h2>

  <p>The manual is written in LaTeX. For those of you unfamiliar with LaTeX, it is a
  markup language (based on TeX), not entierly different from HTML for instance,
  just not quite as structured (it has its roots back in the late 1970's). For more
  information, go to the <a href="http://www.tug.org">TeX Users Group</a>.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, it is a free, highly portable "document format" (or rather,
  typesetting language) that has stood the test of time, and the documents are
  written in plain ASCII text, so it is easy to manage in a version control
  system, for instance. Also, it can render to several different target formats,
  including PDF, PostScript and HTML.</p>

  <p>I might switch to DocBook, or just plain OpenDocument format (e.g. OpenOffice)
  in the future, if that proves to be easier to maintain, but for now I think it is
  a nice format for the documentation (the only real issue is setting up the LaTeX
  environment &mdash; see below).</p>


  <h2>Figures</h2>

  <p>The figures were drawn in OpenOffice, saved as .odg (OpenDocument format) and
  then exported to PDF, which can be used for figures in LaTeX (when building
  the manual as a PDF document). Both the .odg and the .pdf versions of the
  figures are located in the version repository for simplicity.</p>

  <p>Keep in mind that if a .odg file is updated, the corresponding .pdf file should
  be updated too!</p>


  <h2>What you need</h2>

  <p>You need an installation of LaTeX, with a few LaTeX packages to go with it.
  Unfortunataly, this may be quite difficult if you have never installed a LaTeX
  system before. Optimally, everything should work with a standard LaTeX
  installation, but you may run into problems (typically missing TeX packages).</p>

  <p>I installed LaTeX on my PCLinuxOS system using the standard package
  distribution (using Synaptic), and everything worked OK.</p>

  <p>Another alternative (for Windows, for instance) is to download and install
  <a href="http://www.tug.org/texlive/">TeX Live</a>.</p>

  <p>To update the document figures/graphics, the easiest solution is to use
  OpenOffice or some other software that can read OpenDocument format files and
  export PDF files.</p>


  <h2>Building the PDF file</h2>

  <p>Just run "make". Alternatively you can run "pdflatex manual.tex", twice
  (for the TOC to work), and it's done.</p>
